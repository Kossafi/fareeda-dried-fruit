    ],
    "scheduledDate": "2024-01-20T10:00:00Z",
    "notes": "Premium mixed fruit package for holiday season"
  }'
```

### 2. Start Repack Process
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/repack/orders/repack-123/start \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token" \
  -d '{
    "supervisedBy": "supervisor-user-id"
  }'
```

### 3. Complete Repack with Actual Results
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/repack/orders/repack-123/complete \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token" \
  -d '{
    "actualQuantity": 48.5,
    "sourceItemActuals": [
      {
        "inventoryItemId": "dried-mango-item",
        "actualQuantity": 14.8
      },

```

## Repack Order States

- **PLANNED**: Order created and scheduled
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Repack process has started
- **COMPLETED**: Successfully completed with actual results
- **CANCELLED**: Order cancelled before completion

## Smart Features

### Automatic Stock Reservation
When a repack order is created, the system automatically reserves the required source stock to prevent conflicts with other operations.

### Cost Calculation
The system calculates the cost of the target product based on:
- Source item costs and quantities used
- Weighted average cost per unit
- Processing overhead (configurable)

### Efficiency Tracking
- **Yield Efficiency**: (Actual output / Expected output) Ã— 100
- **Cost Efficiency**: Cost per target unit vs. market rates
- **Time Efficiency**: Actual vs. planned processing time

### AI-Powered Suggestions
The system analyzes:
- Excess inventory levels
- Demand patterns
- Cost optimization opportunities
- Expiration dates
- Historical repack performance

## Background Jobs

- Runs hourly to check ready orders
- Validates feasibility before processing
- Detects overdue orders
- Generates optimization suggestions

### Alert System
- Low stock alerts for source materials
