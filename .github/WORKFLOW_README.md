# Note: CI Workflow
The .github/workflows/ci.yml file is currently not pushed to GitHub because it requires a Personal Access Token with 'workflow' scope.

To add the CI workflow:
1. Update your GitHub Personal Access Token to include 'workflow' scope
2. Or manually add the workflow file through GitHub web interface
3. Or push it separately after updating token permissions

The workflow file is ready and can be found locally at:
.github/workflows/ci.yml
